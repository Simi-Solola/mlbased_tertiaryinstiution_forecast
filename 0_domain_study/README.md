# ðŸŽ“ Admission Forecasting for Nigerian Students â€” Using JAMB, WAEC and other relevant data

## Background & Motivation

In Nigeria, gaining admission into a tertiary institution can be a long, uncertain journey. For many students, the process is more than just passing exams â€” itâ€™s a test of patience, resilience, and perseverance. Every year, thousands of hopeful candidates sit for the **Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB)** examinations and complete their **West African Examinations Council (WAEC)** assessments. Yet, despite hard work, many experience delays, repeated applications, or outright rejections.

I understand this reality deeply â€” because Iâ€™ve lived it.  
After completing my secondary school education, I faced an unnecessary and frustrating delay before finally gaining admission into the university. It wasnâ€™t because I lacked ability or passion, but because the system was unpredictable. The uncertainty and wasted time had a profound impact on me, shaping how I view education, data, and decision-making.

This personal experience became my inspiration for this project. I wanted to explore whether **data science** could be used to bring more transparency to the admissions process â€” giving students a better sense of their chances and helping them plan accordingly.

## Problem Statement

Currently, there is no widely accessible tool that predicts a Nigerian studentâ€™s likelihood of gaining admission based on their academic performance and other measurable factors. This leaves candidates in the dark, leading to repeated disappointments, poor planning, and in some cases, loss of motivation.

By analyzing **JAMB** and **WAEC** performance data â€” along with other relevant admission criteria â€” this project aims to build a **predictive model** that forecasts the probability of admission.

## Project Goal

The primary goal is to use **machine learning techniques** to:

- Analyze historical admission patterns in Nigerian universities.
- Identify the key factors that influence admission decisions.
- Develop a tool that predicts a studentâ€™s likelihood of gaining admission based on their scores and other features.

Beyond the technical challenge, this project is a personal mission:  
To ensure that future students donâ€™t have
