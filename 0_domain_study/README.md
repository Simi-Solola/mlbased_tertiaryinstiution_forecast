# Background Study  

University admission in Nigeria is a high-stakes process that involves millions
of applicants competing for limited slots each year. The **Joint Admissions and
Matriculation Board (JAMB)** coordinates the process by administering the Unified
Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) and forwarding results to tertiary
institutions.  

However, the final admission decision depends on a complex interplay of factors:

- **UTME scores** and subject combinations  
- **Post-UTME or screening scores** set by individual institutions  
- **O’level (WAEC/NECO) results** and subject grades  
- **Institutional admission quotas** as determined by the National Universities
Commission (NUC)  
- **Catchment area policies and educationally less developed states (ELDS)
considerations**  

For many prospective students, predicting their likelihood of admission is
difficult due to the lack of publicly available,
structured data and the variability of institutional policies. This uncertainty
often leads to:  

- Multiple applications to less-preferred institutions  
- Poor decision-making in course selection  
- Increased stress for applicants and their families  

**Machine learning** offers a way to bridge this gap by analyzing historical
admission trends alongside applicant data to forecast admission outcomes. By
training on past data — including UTME scores, institutional cut-offs, and
program-specific criteria — a predictive system can estimate the probability of
admission for a given student profile.  

This project seeks to develop a **data-driven admission forecasting model**
tailored to the Nigerian tertiary education context. The goal is not to replace
institutional decision-making but to **empower applicants** with insights that
improve planning, reduce uncertainty, and increase the transparency of the
admission process.
